                Australia Car Covers is one of the largest car cover suppliers
                worldwide with presence in the US, Canada, UK, & Australia.
                Leveraging on our ability to procure top quality goods, we’ve
                been able to create an excellent customer service & experience
                in providing top quality products. We pride ourselves in using
                only top notch materials such as 600D polyester and 7 layer
                non-woven polypropylene and source our raw materials from well
                known, reputable fabric suppliers. Details in car covers are
                crucial in providing the highest quality. Details such as fleece
                lining, buckle/strap system, air vents, grommets, UV protection
                & many more are important in not only protecting your vehicle,
                but also ensuring your car cover lasts a lifetime. So whether
                you are looking for the softest cover or a heavy-duty made,
                durable cover to protect your vehicle from any type of weather
                conditions and dirt elements, we have it all for you.
